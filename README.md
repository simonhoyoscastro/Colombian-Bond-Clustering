# Colombian-Bond-Clustering
In this project, we obtained data pertaining to the Colombia Government and Corporate Bonds from the Bloomberg Terminal. Our objective is to meticulously clean and preprocess this data and then apply the powerful KMeans algorithm for the purpose of categorizing these bonds based on their inherent characteristics.
